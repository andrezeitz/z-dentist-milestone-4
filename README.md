## Design

### Fonts
I have chosen Lato for the header and logo as it is easy to read and has sufficient contrast to the main body font. The small caps style is used by Roboto that I feel look very clean in the quiz.

### Colors
The site features complementary Blue Crayola Forest Green Web, Pacific Blue, white and black to create a good contrast and improve readability.

The colors chosen are:
